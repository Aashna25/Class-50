# CSS and Flexbox

● Create a separate CSS style sheet for the portfolio website. 

● Use <div> blocks and flexbox to give a layout to the website. 

● Use css selectors to add style elements to the website.

Creating a CSS is quite simple. 

1. Create an empty file in the same folder and call it style.css (or any other name. The extension .css is important) This is going to be our style sheet. 

2. Copy the style content (inside style tags) to this style sheet. We are going to add more styling to our document in this and the next class. 

3. This stylesheet needs to be linked to the html file. We do it using the <link/> tag.

   We had used * symbol to create a box around all the html content. All these boxes are separate and independent of each other.

   We create a big box using <div></div> tags. All the html content we want inside the big box can be put in these div blocks. For example, let's say we want the website header name (inside h1 tag) and the menu items inside one big box. Let's create a div block which holds them.
